# Adder-Circuit-with-Carry-Latch-and-LED-Based-Output-Display-using-Verilog

This module implements a basic full adder that adds two inputs, tracks the carry output, and drives several LEDs based on the sum, carry, and some internal timing logic. The additional counters create a half-second pulse, which controls the state of other LEDs (LED4 and LED5). It can also latch and display the carry status via LED3.
